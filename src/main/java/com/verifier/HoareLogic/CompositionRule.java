    // TODO: Implement the Hoare Logic rule for sequential composition.
    // Requirements:
    // 1. Accept a Sequence statement containing multiple statements.
    // 2. Process the sequence of statements in reverse order for backward reasoning:
    //    - Use ConditionUtils.simplify(post) after processing each statement to ensure the postcondition remains clean.
    //    - Derive the precondition for each statement based on the postcondition of the next.
    //
    // 3. Use the appropriate rule (e.g., AssignmentRule, ConditionalRule) to generate VerificationConditions for each statement.
    //
    // 4. Return a list of VerificationConditions for the entire sequence.
    //
    // 5. Ensure correct chaining of preconditions and postconditions between statements by applying ConditionUtils to handle logical operations as needed.
